### Hello, my name is Michael 👋

I am a Freelance Data Scientist and Software Engineer working at the intersection of sustainability and tech. I help startups, NGO's, and clean tech companies to make use of their data and turn it into useful products and dashboards.

My goal is to build tools that enable the people who use them to become more efficient, have insights they could not have before and therewith helping them to identify the most impactful next step. I do this through analytics, MVP's or data pipelines.

Before freelancing, i worked in engineering consultancy and data science roles across the sustainability space. My work spans from building physics consultancy, data and BI engineering and in e-government projects, to data science in clean tech startups. I always try to combine my experience with my hands-on mindset (having made a apprenticeship as bricklayer originally) and fast feedback cycles to make sure i am aligned on the project goal.

In 2025, i launched [bytebricks.ch](https://bytebricks.ch?ref=githubReadme), a Swiss Product Development (some may call it MVPs) and Data Engineering Studio. The goal of bytebricks is to help non-technical early-stage founders and organizations build fast and lightweight software solutions. The belief is that many established software companies overengineer and -complicate solutions. This is especially true if someone just wants to test the waters and see if an idea is worth more investment. Here is a light approach wich fast feedback loops needed and not a fully fetched solution which would already scale to millions of users or covers every edge case. But get something up and running as fast as possible and iterate on the outcome.

I also contribute to open-source projects and run niche jobboards like [NextGenEnergyJobs.com](https://nextgenenergyjobs.com?ref=githubReadme) to connect people with clean energy jobs.

I love being outdoor and do something, be it cycling, running, or climbing. These are lately mostly slower, lower and with a strawler.

🛠️ I'm open to freelance collaborations, MVP builds, and data science consulting. Reach out in one of the below sources if you think we might be a good fit.
